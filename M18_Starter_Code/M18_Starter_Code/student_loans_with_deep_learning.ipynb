Describe the data that you would need to collect to build a recommendation system to recommend student loan options for students. Explain why this data would be relevant and appropriate.**\n","\n","In oder to build a recommendation system to recommend student loand options we would need to include the following data:\n","\n","*   co-signers: information about anyone that would be able to co-sign with the student loan of the student e.g., co-signer's income, employement status, age\n","*   demographic information such as age, location and education level\n","*   credit histry of the student\n","\n","This data would be appropriate if it is numeric or catigorical because a recommendation system needs to have non-textual data to build the model.  Also, by adding in co-signer information that will limit the liability of company (if a payment is missed or defered there is another person to collect payment).  By adding in demographic information to the model we can predict financial solvency for the loan (individuals with greater education levels typically make more money than less educated, older individual are typically more finacially secure and location because of deposible cash due to living expenses).  \n","\n","**2. Based on the data you chose to use in this recommendation system, would your model be using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or context-based filtering? Justify why the data you selected would be suitable for your choice of filtering method.**\n","\n","I would suggest that we use a combination of context and content-based filtering because this will better take into account the circumstances of the borrower who is applying for the loan and if they like the loan options that we are offering to the student.  For instance, payment and credit history will tell you what the student has done in the past while the student's income will tell you if they will be able to afford a payment - context-based arguments. While content-based would provide loan options for the student including items like interest rate, loan amount or the duration of the loan.  \n","\n","\n","**3. Describe two real-world challenges that you would take into consideration while building a recommendation system for student loans. Explain why these challenges would be of concern for a student loan recommendation system.**\n","\n","Securing the data (1) and appending it to the student file(2) would be  challeges.\n","\n","There are multiple steps in being able to secure the data and this might include data privacy and general security. If the vast majority of the individuals are younger then thier finacial history might be more difficult to secure due to privacy concerns. Addiitonally, general security surrounding financial data is intense as well, there are multiple levels of security to get to individua level data that this company might not be able to pass.\n","\n","Which brings us to... there is data out there but typically these data do not have a one to one link to each individual's financial history.  This would mean that we would have to deploy imputation techniques or dataframes that do not have all data that would be needed to make a great recommender system - both would degrade the model slightly.   \n","\n","\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
